Metadata about these shards (a unique\\n    shard ID and the total shard count) is stored in the primary DataStore entry for the\\n    original key, while the actual shard data is stored under separate keys derived from\\n    the shard ID.\\n2.  **Compression:** Before sharding, the JSON-encoded data is converted to binary using\\n    `buffer.fromstring`. This binary representation is then JSON-encoded *again* before\\n    being split into UTF-8 safe shards using `splitUtf8String`. Roblox automatically\\n\\tcompresses buffers when encoding them using `JSONEncode`. This helps reduce the\\n    number of shards required, minimizing DataStore requests.\\n\\n**Shard Key Naming:** Shard data is stored using keys formatted as `{shardId}-{shardIndex}`,\\nwhere `shardId` is a unique GUID generated for the file and `shardIndex` is the 1-based\\nindex of the shard.","private":true,"source":{"line":27,"path":"src/Files.luau"}}')}}]);
