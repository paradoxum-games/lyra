All involved keys must be loaded via load() before calling tx(). The transformFunction receives a table where keys are the data keys and values are the current data states. It can modify this state table. It must return true to commit the transaction or false to abort. Implementation Details: Uses PromiseQueue.multiQueueAdd to ensure the transform function only runs when all involved session queues are ready. Uses a temporary txLockPromise on sessions to block concurrent update calls while the transaction logic is executing. Performs a two-phase commit using a transaction marker in the txStore: Write false to txStore under a unique txId. Update all primary recordStore entries with the new data and txId. If successful, remove the txId entry from txStore. If any step fails, attempts to revert changes by rewriting records without the txId and removing the txId marker. Uses JsonPatch to calculate differences for efficient storage in TxInfo. Propagates DataStore errors encountered during the commit or revert phases.

When you load a player's data, Lyra 'locks' it, which gives your server exclusive access to that data. This is crucial - without session locking, multiple servers might try to modify the same player's data simultaneously, leading to race conditions and lost data.  Here's how you work with sessions:  Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player) -- Establish exclusive access to the player's data store:loadAsync(player) end) Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player) -- Release the lock and save any pending changes store:unloadAsync(player) end)   Loading a session is always your first step.

Data Consistency: When external state and Lyra diverge (e.g., if a Lyra update fails), reconciling the differences becomes complex.
